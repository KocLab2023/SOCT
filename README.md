# SOCT
Secure Outsourcing Computation Toolkit (SOCT)  using Threshold ElGamal Algorithm

This toolkit is based on the dual-server decryption architecture using a (2,2) threshold additively homomorphic ElGamal (TAHEG) algorithm.

The "gmpy2 2.1.5" was required in this work. 
You can run "algorithmTest.py" to test the (2,2) TAHEG algorithm, and run "protocolsTest.py" to test the additional functions of Secure Multiplication Function,  Secure Comparison Function, Secure Sign and Magnitude Acquisition Function
